## [Space Invaders](https://codegym.cc/projects/games/com.codegym.games.spaceinvaders)

### Rules:
- The object of the game is for the player to destroy every alien spaceship.
- The player controls a laser cannon and can move it left and right at the bottom of the screen.
- The player has an unlimited supply of "laser projectiles". When the player hits an alien ship, he or she kills it and receives some points.
- When the game begins, the alien ships are located at the top of the screen. They move horizontally and, upon reaching the edge of the playing field, descend to the next row, gradually getting closer to the player.
- As the number of alien ships decreases, the remaining ships begin to move faster.
- After all the aliens are destroyed, the player wins.
- The aliens try to destroy the player's cannon by shooting at it. If an alien hits the cannon, the player loses.
- If even one alien reaches the bottom of the screen, the alien invasion succeeds and the game ends.
- A "boss" is located above the rows of alien ships. If the player destroys the boss, he or she receives bonus points.

### Future Tasks:
- Add other types of ships.
- Change the number of cannons on the ships.
- Add new types of projectiles.
- Change the scoring system: for example, the more quickly a ship is destroyed, the more points it gives.
- Add bunkers for the player.
- Give bonuses for hitting a certain ship: for example, temporary invincibility, super weapons, etc.
- In the event of a win, advance to a harder level.
